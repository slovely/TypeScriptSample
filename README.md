# TypeScriptSample
This repository a sample use of TypeLite library to generate strong models for your web API, and contains the code documented in the blog series here: http://blog.simonlovely.com/archive/2014/11/07/typelite-has-gone-v1.0/

Please note, that since that series I've created a nuget package that does most of the work for you.  See https://github.com/slovely/TypeScriptDefinitionsGenerator/ for more information.
